#### Run "Main_CompleteSampling.r" to compute the structural constraint across the empirical networks
#### The code will sample all the possible group at fix dimension. If the network is too large the running time will be too long 
#### For large networks use "Main_randomSampling.r" which sample random groups with same dimensions

#### For example to analyze the data linked to the code use "Main_CompleteSampling.r" for plot number one and two only
#### Use "Main_randomSampling.r" to analyze plot number 3
