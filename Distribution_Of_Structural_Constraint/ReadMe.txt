#### Run "Main_CompleteSampling.r" to compute the structural constraint across empirical networks
#### The data associated with the code can be found at: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.77rn2
#### The code will sample all the possible groups at fix dimension. 
#### Note that the number of groups grows too fast with the dimension of the networks
#### For large networks use "Main_randomSampling.r" which sample a user fixed number of random groups

#### For example to analyze the data linked to the code use "Main_CompleteSampling.r" for field number one and two only
#### Use "Main_randomSampling.r" to analyze field number 3
