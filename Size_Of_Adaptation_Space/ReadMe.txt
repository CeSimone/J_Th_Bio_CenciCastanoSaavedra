### Size of Adaptation Space. In this folder there are two sub folders:

###	a) DistinctFeasibilityDomains: compute the nfraction of distinct feasibility domains generated by the reorganization of the interactions within a group of species
###	b) DistanceBetweenDomains: Compute the distance between feasibility domains, inside the adaptation space, as function of the structural constraint of a group
